# 3D_Raycasting_Game
Cub3d is a project from the 42 Network curriculum where you create a simple 3D game using raycasting with vectors instead of angles. Inspired by classic games like Wolfenstein 3D, this project involves rendering a 3D environment from a 2D map and implementing basic game mechanics.
